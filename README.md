This is my first Angular project where I learned about:
* Components and their State Management
* Page Routing
* Services, Http Requesting, and Observables

# To run it ...
1. clone this repository, then npm install
2. npm start (to start the angular server)
3. npm server (to start the backend server)
4. open localhost:4200 in the browser
